1
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:33,450
Why don't you look at me?
Look at me.

2
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,033
Are you shy?

3
00:00:38,617 --> 00:00:40,783
So, yes.

4
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:42,492
Completely quiet.

5
00:00:44,242 --> 00:00:46,492
Be yourself. Be confident.

6
00:00:54,242 --> 00:00:56,742
It's over soon.

7
00:00:58,117 --> 00:00:59,783
It is well.

8
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:02,617
Very good.

9
00:01:07,242 --> 00:01:08,867
Hi, Pierre.

10
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,646
Curiosity: Erotic object, book
or photograph. Collector's term.

11
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:13,575
It was a long time ago.

12
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:16,492
Too long. I've missed you.

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,158
Stylish as always.

14
00:01:36,117 --> 00:01:38,825
Hi, Pierre. How are you?

15
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,950
- What if we were blondes?
- Then they would adore us.

16
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:56,242
- Who put the daffodils there?
- Flowers love their mirror image.

17
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,908
- A little like you, dear sister.
- Loulouse!

18
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,242
Now stop, you know that
Loulouse is reminiscent of a cactus.

19
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:05,700
- What am I then?
- You?

20
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,283
A rose bud.

21
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:10,950
Ready to bloom.

22
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:13,658
- It's about time.
- Don't worry, Hélène.

23
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:16,950
- Henri loves to puzzle in the garden.
- Green thumb?

24
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:18,992
- Pierre?
- I think.

25
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:25,867
- You have to grow your garden.
- They're not acting for you.

26
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,658
I'm sorry I didn't pray
about the Pharaoh's permission.

27
00:02:30,742 --> 00:02:34,617
- But admit it is tempting.
- See you later.

28
00:02:35,742 --> 00:02:39,908
- Can he smell with all the nose hairs?
- Facial hair tickles.

29
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:42,283
Okay? Have you already kissed one?

30
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,533
Only Dad's mustache.

31
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:51,950
Pierre...

32
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,992
- Are you going to tea, Jean?
- Of course.

33
00:02:58,117 --> 00:03:01,325
- Don't I get a little kiss?
- You get exactly what you want.

34
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:04,492
Everything. What you want.

35
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:09,450
What happy future husbands.

36
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:10,950
Pierre...

37
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,033
Girls, leave Pierre alone.

38
00:03:14,117 --> 00:03:17,325
- He has grown from childhood.
- I like them.

39
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,075
You are incorrigible.

40
00:03:24,908 --> 00:03:27,658
Henri, are you writing a poem collection?

41
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:29,825
- Yes.
- Recite something.

42
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:32,242
- With pleasure.
- I am listening.

43
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:35,992
Heron in bog or swan in lake

44
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:38,992
Spring blooms or the fall rains

45
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:41,700
have my arrows pierced every one hour

46
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:44,700
- Time has picked
- ...all its feathers

47
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:48,908
Strutty breasts, naked as a mother's

48
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,742
- Their silky defeat
- ...lying on the floor

49
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:54,033
and naked

50
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:57,949
with torn dress completely on the slopes

51
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,950
- It's not like that at all!
- No.

52
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:02,325
I knew it!

53
00:04:04,575 --> 00:04:05,950
Excuse me.

54
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,533
We unmarried girls always make us.

55
00:04:13,575 --> 00:04:17,492
As houses that cannot be rented,
but who are just waiting for buyers.

56
00:04:17,575 --> 00:04:19,492
Ask Antonine to serve the teen.

57
00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:24,117
We can receive visits,
but not on all floors.

58
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,575
Dare not imagine see her undressed.

59
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:31,533
Marie, wait for me!

60
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:34,575
Antonine needs help.

61
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:33,575
My dear Henri, I am in love with Marie.

62
00:05:33,658 --> 00:05:37,533
The only way to save her
for this unnecessary rivalry,

63
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:40,575
is to tell her about this shared love.

64
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:42,783
Your friend, Pierre.

65
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:03,158
You are beautiful. Very beautiful.

66
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,450
He is nice.
He'll probably take good care of you.

67
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,992
- I like him.
- It's a good start.

68
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:22,575
Marie?

69
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:27,450
Are you coming straight?

70
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:01,492
I just wanted to hear, how it stands.

71
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:04,033
- You're my friend.
- Your friend?

72
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:08,700
After you communicate via a telegram me
about such a crucial decision?

73
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,992
I'm in love with Marie.
What's the problem?

74
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:22,793
We had a deal,

75
00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:25,918
but I took the chance
when you did nothing.

76
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:28,783
- Unsportsmanlike.
- My love is stronger than yours.

77
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:31,200
- You lied.
- I was desperate.

78
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:34,117
- Enough to fail a friend?
- Yes.

79
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:38,492
Enough to fail the best friend,
I have had.

80
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,908
I love her beyond all boundaries.

81
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:57,117
How do you want to get out of this?
I admit you are doing well.

82
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:01,117
The love... So you believe in it?

83
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:06,450
For me,
love is gratification of the senses.

84
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:08,575
Then you've never loved.

85
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:11,908
Love, Henri,

86
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:17,283
is a freshly shaved little dung,
washed and perfumed from head to toe,

87
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:22,075
prepared for other doctors if asked.
Round and firm.

88
00:09:22,158 --> 00:09:26,200
Extremely tight and delightfully juicy.

89
00:09:27,242 --> 00:09:29,242
Do I shock you?

90
00:09:31,158 --> 00:09:32,783
That was the point, wasn't it?

91
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:43,367
I was getting worried.

92
00:09:44,992 --> 00:09:46,575
Reach?

93
00:09:48,075 --> 00:09:50,033
How was the piece?

94
00:09:50,117 --> 00:09:53,742
Sardou came up with a cunning title:
"Let's get divorced!"

95
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:55,992
The theater was full of women!

96
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:59,950
I invited my sisters on ice.
Now I have no more money.

97
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:03,950
- I saw a hat I can't afford.
- But Marie...

98
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:07,533
Women do not go to a café alone.

99
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:09,658
Except courtesy.

100
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:16,533
"Freshly shaved mis ..."

101
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,158
Henri? What happens?

102
00:10:20,325 --> 00:10:22,283
I met Pierre.

103
00:10:23,158 --> 00:10:25,158
Is he back?

104
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:29,283
And not alone.
He brought an Algeria in the luggage.

105
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:32,450
An enchanting girl, I've heard.

106
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:36,658
He claims she is his muse.
He seems completely bewitched.

107
00:10:38,242 --> 00:10:40,825
He can't help it to photograph her.

108
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:02,908
- Madam.
- Monsieur.

109
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:06,492
- Good day.
- Good evening.

110
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,617
- To me?
- Here you go.

111
00:11:27,158 --> 00:11:29,450
Your trip.

112
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:33,242
Lovely bag.

113
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,033
Careful, it's fragile.

114
00:11:53,283 --> 00:11:55,575
First act.

115
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:00,867
- Again. Clear?
- Ready.

116
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:05,200
- Do you like it?
- I love it!

117
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:07,825
- More!
- Again.

118
00:12:12,117 --> 00:12:13,992
Hurry, Jean!

119
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:16,533
Clear.

120
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:10,033
- Yes?
- Is Pierre here?

121
00:13:10,075 --> 00:13:13,992
- He works and will not be disturbed.
- I'm used to it.

122
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:23,075
Marie.

123
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:26,242
Henri said you had turned
back with...

124
00:13:27,658 --> 00:13:29,908
Zohra Ben Brahim.

125
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:31,158
She is pretty.

126
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:36,950
Let me introduce Marie de Heredia.
The rain! I forget it.

127
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,950
It's strange to call you that.

128
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:42,950
It's lovely here.

129
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:49,283
A few flowers are missing.
Buy some daffodils.

130
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:51,617
I saw someone in the market.

131
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,242
You like daffodils, Pierre?

132
00:14:16,075 --> 00:14:18,158
Are you jealous?

133
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:27,700
Do you photograph her with this one?

134
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,075
It was you I wanted.

135
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:52,242
I was furious when he stole you.

136
00:15:17,075 --> 00:15:19,950
May a fall night never occur...

137
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:22,158
Did you save yourself for me?

138
00:15:23,408 --> 00:15:28,658
- May a fall night never occur...
- So I, who embrace you here...

139
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:33,200
...don't give you...

140
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,408
...the gold, myrrh and
frankincense of your innocence.

141
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:40,658
And Aphrodite's blood.

142
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:43,950
And Aphrodite's blood.

143
00:15:43,992 --> 00:15:45,908
And Leto's blood.

144
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:01,033
Thanks.

145
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,492
Can I see?

146
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:16,117
- Are you now interested in politics?
- I want to learn.

147
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,867
I post a contact ad.

148
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:27,075
Code Name: MLH.

149
00:16:27,158 --> 00:16:30,992
The initials of your names:
Marie, Louise, Hélène.

150
00:16:38,325 --> 00:16:39,950
Extremely interesting.

151
00:16:58,908 --> 00:17:04,742
Pierre, I want to be photographed
in immoral positions.

152
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,867
Come in, Marie!

153
00:17:40,908 --> 00:17:43,658
So you want to be photographed?

154
00:17:45,158 --> 00:17:47,950
It's like being in a studio.

155
00:17:49,158 --> 00:17:52,075
- Should I sit here?
- Keep your hat on.

156
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:54,825
First I want to take your portrait.

157
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,617
Like a stranger I've met on the street.

158
00:17:59,908 --> 00:18:01,533
Take a seat.

159
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:22,033
Marie, you have to sit still.

160
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:25,742
Imagine you are an apple.
Are apples moving?

161
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:38,950
Turn your head to the right.

162
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:43,242
Lower your chin.

163
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:44,658
Well.

164
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,325
- Smile a little less. Concentrate.
- I'm concentrated.

165
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,825
Take off the hat.

166
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:33,742
When I can't become your husband,
I want to be your lover.

167
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:37,908
I want to teach you things,
which you cannot imagine.

168
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:42,315
You have to write to me
and describe your enjoyment.

169
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:43,377
Do we agree?

170
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:52,283
It's me you love, right?

171
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:54,117
Love?

172
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,200
This is pure fun.

173
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:59,158
Or the opposite.

174
00:22:24,825 --> 00:22:26,908
I will call you "The Fly"

175
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:31,575
because of your winged black hair,
so far, so fine, so blue

176
00:22:31,658 --> 00:22:34,658
and the golden circles about your pupils

177
00:22:34,742 --> 00:22:37,658
in the deep shadow of your eyes.

178
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:51,408
We even have installed "Water closets".

179
00:22:58,575 --> 00:23:01,908
Love letters will now
floating around with shit.

180
00:23:02,742 --> 00:23:05,825
- There you are.
- Pierre! Are you here?

181
00:23:06,742 --> 00:23:10,658
- Back from my journey.
- You are late.

182
00:23:10,742 --> 00:23:13,992
I was with my lover.
He refused to let me go.

183
00:23:14,075 --> 00:23:16,908
She has not lost her humor.

184
00:23:20,075 --> 00:23:23,575
Well, Pierre... How was your journey?

185
00:23:23,658 --> 00:23:26,950
So fantastic, that you missed our wedding.

186
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:30,242
That's Marie's way of saying,
that we missed you.

187
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,825
We are home births now.

188
00:23:31,908 --> 00:23:36,783
Everyday simple life with Marie
makes me so happy.

189
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:38,617
Everyday life is boring.

190
00:23:38,742 --> 00:23:42,117
Tell us about your journey.
It's more entertaining.

191
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,367
It is impossible to summarize.
Impressions, colors, images.

192
00:23:48,325 --> 00:23:50,617
I wish, that I had photographed it all.

193
00:23:51,325 --> 00:23:54,367
- He loves his Kodak.
- And Kodak?

194
00:23:55,783 --> 00:23:58,117
We also took pictures.

195
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,575
Are you cute picking them up?

196
00:24:00,658 --> 00:24:02,325
Gladly.

197
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,200
- You are crazy.
- May I come over to the studio?

198
00:24:13,283 --> 00:24:15,450
I promise to behave properly.

199
00:24:16,908 --> 00:24:19,867
- Do you promise to do as I say?
- Everything you say.

200
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,575
Here they are.

201
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:40,075
Then we'll see...

202
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,950
The whole family was there.

203
00:24:43,117 --> 00:24:44,950
Everyone except you.

204
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,658
Was it the best day of your life?

205
00:24:49,742 --> 00:24:52,200
Yes, it was very touching.

206
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:58,617
- You'll see that when it's your turn.
- If it ever becomes.

207
00:25:06,908 --> 00:25:10,117
Do you see how fun it was?
I look absolutely dead.

208
00:25:22,283 --> 00:25:24,950
My lover wouldn't let me.

209
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:30,200
And her husband considered the excuse

210
00:25:30,283 --> 00:25:32,992
like a bad joke.

211
00:25:33,755 --> 00:25:36,364
I don't like the housekeeper
with his luscious mouth so wide,

212
00:25:36,374 --> 00:25:39,867
who says to his new hubby,
with head tilted:

213
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:43,533
"If the Lord calls, when he lays down,"

214
00:25:43,617 --> 00:25:47,200
"can I perform a 69
as an extra number on you!"

215
00:25:47,283 --> 00:25:49,867
- Which floor?
- The highest.

216
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,117
You're trying to take my life.

217
00:25:53,575 --> 00:25:56,575
You have to introduce me to Lucille.

218
00:25:56,658 --> 00:25:57,742
Lucille...

219
00:25:57,783 --> 00:26:02,700
But you are always with Zohra
and your new little whore.

220
00:26:02,783 --> 00:26:06,867
- She's not a whore.
- Then why are you hiding her?

221
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,408
- Do you think we can catch her?
- Lift!

222
00:26:10,492 --> 00:26:12,908
- Lift up now!
- Does she come from the upper class?

223
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,950
She comes from the upper class!

224
00:26:24,755 --> 00:26:27,158
Monsieur Pierre, I want to fuck.

225
00:26:29,658 --> 00:26:33,492
Don't say "I want to fuck",
say "I'm nervous".

226
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:37,950
Oh my beloved! Fuck me in both holes!

227
00:26:39,325 --> 00:26:42,158
You might well call yourself an eclectic.

228
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:45,992
I have 12 dildos in the desk drawer.

229
00:26:47,617 --> 00:26:51,450
Say instead,
"I'm bored never in my own company."

230
00:26:54,825 --> 00:26:56,867
Now I have to show you something.

231
00:27:13,825 --> 00:27:15,992
"The woman's buttocks."

232
00:27:34,617 --> 00:27:37,950
- How many are there?
- About 60.

233
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:40,783
- And all in all?
- Several hundreds.

234
00:27:41,658 --> 00:27:43,283
Several hundreds?

235
00:27:48,408 --> 00:27:51,858
I have information on the ones
I had anal sex with.

236
00:27:51,869 --> 00:27:53,460
Name, address, age.

237
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:55,575
A fascinating study.

238
00:27:55,658 --> 00:27:57,617
Saw fingerprints?

239
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,200
It's just before.

240
00:27:59,283 --> 00:28:02,367
Frankly, why are you writing it down?

241
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,283
I do not know.

242
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,617
I shouldn't have shown you.

243
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,575
Allow me to be a little... surprised.

244
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,908
It is unfamiliar to me with a notebook
for classifying women.

245
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:21,575
Take the plunge.

246
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:31,325
Are we ugly or pretty?

247
00:28:32,992 --> 00:28:35,867
You laugh and I show teeth.

248
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:40,200
I like your pupils,
because I can see myself in them.

249
00:28:40,242 --> 00:28:44,283
When I loosen your braid,

250
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:46,825
you weigh my heavy hair.

251
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:50,450
And to your scarlet tongue
I have some coral.

252
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:51,658
Reach?

253
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,075
Not bad.

254
00:28:53,158 --> 00:28:56,200
- Not bad?
- Pretty good, actually.

255
00:28:56,992 --> 00:28:59,117
Is it a lesbian poem?

256
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,950
Are you trying to kill me?

257
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,158
- How can you handle this?
- I'm used to suffering.

258
00:29:17,325 --> 00:29:20,658
Are you getting strangled? Do you?

259
00:29:23,742 --> 00:29:26,075
How does it feel to have one?

260
00:29:26,158 --> 00:29:27,908
Can you show me that?

261
00:29:28,575 --> 00:29:31,575
Next time I'll take a woman more with.

262
00:29:31,658 --> 00:29:34,242
We can love with her both.

263
00:29:35,825 --> 00:29:37,908
It's going to do you good.

264
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:40,367
She will look at you.

265
00:29:42,492 --> 00:29:44,867
- Don't you have enough in me?
- Yes, but...

266
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,783
- But?
- Three is more fun.

267
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:56,492
She can lie between us and look at you.

268
00:30:05,755 --> 00:30:09,492
- You're playing with me.
- Not with you. I'm just healing.

269
00:30:11,783 --> 00:30:15,283
I hate you. I hate you!

270
00:30:15,408 --> 00:30:18,992
Who? Do you have other mistresses?

271
00:30:19,075 --> 00:30:23,117
I love you less, if I have others?

272
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:28,075
- Reply. Do you have it?
- Would I love you less?

273
00:30:28,158 --> 00:30:30,575
Of course, I have others.

274
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:36,325
- It doesn't change anything.
- Would I, if I had others?

275
00:30:36,492 --> 00:30:38,950
- You may not.
- Well, I must.

276
00:30:38,992 --> 00:30:41,450
- Well, I must.
- Do not.

277
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,825
Only you can do me good.

278
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:53,367
Your poem was much more fun.

279
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,617
Have you written it?

280
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,867
- Have you read Pierre's manuscript?
- The first pages.

281
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,908
I have a few objections.
But not in terms of style.

282
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,742
- What are you talking about?
- Pierre.

283
00:31:11,867 --> 00:31:14,533
His book, "The Woman and the Doll".

284
00:31:14,617 --> 00:31:17,242
What does the woman look like?

285
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:21,117
The dark hair, as usual,
and extremely seductive.

286
00:31:21,242 --> 00:31:26,283
He writes well,
but he goes a little too far.

287
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,950
I don't believe it.
A street girl who manipulates

288
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:34,200
his benefactor like a puppet doll.

289
00:31:34,242 --> 00:31:37,783
A gentleman lets don't say lace so easily.

290
00:31:37,908 --> 00:31:40,075
Pierre has imagination.

291
00:31:40,158 --> 00:31:43,469
She lies with someone else,
and he allows it.

292
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,918
Is it credible?

293
00:31:44,992 --> 00:31:47,742
Not quite, I must admit.

294
00:33:32,533 --> 00:33:33,992
The fly!

295
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,658
Do you have no morals?

296
00:33:36,742 --> 00:33:39,742
- Does it bother you?
- No, that's what bothers me.

297
00:33:47,242 --> 00:33:50,450
Not yet. First, I want to photograph you.

298
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,325
You are beautiful when you concentrate.

299
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,992
On the floor.

300
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:12,908
- I'm not allowed to move?
- Or talk.

301
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,575
Be quiet.

302
00:34:18,117 --> 00:34:20,200
Give me a torment of conscience.

303
00:34:20,283 --> 00:34:22,158
Many ailments of conscience.

304
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:38,117
I want to remember every second.

305
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:47,825
Am I part of your collection now.
Along with all the others?

306
00:34:47,908 --> 00:34:51,950
- Did you mess up my stuff?
- Yeah, didn't I have to?

307
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,908
Kiss Me.

308
00:35:22,283 --> 00:35:24,617
Can't you stay a little longer?

309
00:35:28,825 --> 00:35:32,658
- I am late.
- It's like you left.

310
00:35:39,408 --> 00:35:40,867
Help me.

311
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:02,033
- This?
- I'll take it, please.

312
00:36:02,117 --> 00:36:03,533
10 sou.

313
00:36:04,825 --> 00:36:06,492
Here you go.

314
00:36:09,755 --> 00:36:10,555
Flowers?

315
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:13,617
- How much?
- 10 o'clock, sir.

316
00:36:19,658 --> 00:36:20,992
Get dressed.

317
00:36:32,075 --> 00:36:33,950
Up with your arms.

318
00:36:34,033 --> 00:36:35,950
Yes, like that.

319
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,075
Well.

320
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,700
Turn around.

321
00:36:53,742 --> 00:36:55,200
Slowly.

322
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:29,950
It must be dark.

323
00:37:37,992 --> 00:37:39,617
Let me see.

324
00:37:41,117 --> 00:37:42,867
Show me them.

325
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,033
Reach?

326
00:37:45,775 --> 00:37:46,742
Wait...

327
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,325
Come in.

328
00:38:03,492 --> 00:38:04,950
See.

329
00:38:11,658 --> 00:38:12,992
May I have it?

330
00:38:15,783 --> 00:38:17,950
For our secret album?

331
00:38:40,242 --> 00:38:42,215
Who is the woman
who is together with Pierre?

332
00:38:42,226 --> 00:38:43,168
She is wonderful.

333
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,117
Marriage dresses you. You are enchanting.

334
00:39:05,033 --> 00:39:09,075
If it has its hidden benefits,
I haven't discovered them yet.

335
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:18,575
Good to see you dressed.

336
00:39:40,242 --> 00:39:42,325
I do not feel so good.

337
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,908
We are going home.

338
00:39:44,908 --> 00:39:48,283
- I rarely come out!
- People are watching.

339
00:39:50,033 --> 00:39:52,950
- I can not.
- Marie, stop.

340
00:39:55,492 --> 00:39:58,617
Marie, we go a little discreet later.

341
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,325
93rd

342
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:17,700
94th

343
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:20,075
95th

344
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,033
100th

345
00:40:47,867 --> 00:40:49,700
Good night, Marie.

346
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:52,450
Good night.

347
00:41:17,283 --> 00:41:19,825
Henri is back at five. We are alone.

348
00:41:19,908 --> 00:41:21,325
You're not really smart.

349
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:39,408
Don't make fun of him.

350
00:42:52,117 --> 00:42:54,200
Pierre doesn't love you!

351
00:42:54,283 --> 00:42:56,867
He shares Zohra with his friends at night.

352
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,158
You saw how captivated he is!

353
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,825
Stop.

354
00:43:03,575 --> 00:43:05,575
Stop.

355
00:43:06,492 --> 00:43:08,950
You're hurting me.

356
00:43:10,242 --> 00:43:12,033
You're hurting me!

357
00:43:12,117 --> 00:43:13,908
What is it you want?

358
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:16,992
Being treated like Zohra? Like a whore?

359
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,658
My Beloved...

360
00:43:23,658 --> 00:43:25,700
Stop it.

361
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,158
What have I done to you?

362
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:46,658
I do not love you.

363
00:43:46,742 --> 00:43:48,492
I do not love you.

364
00:43:48,575 --> 00:43:50,867
I do not love you.

365
00:43:54,825 --> 00:43:56,867
I do not love you!

366
00:45:58,158 --> 00:46:01,908
Her body was expressive like a face.

367
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,742
More than one face.

368
00:46:03,825 --> 00:46:06,867
Her head rested on her shoulders

369
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:09,200
like something that doesn't matter.

370
00:46:09,242 --> 00:46:12,075
The smiles in the hips,

371
00:46:12,158 --> 00:46:15,575
the extinguishing children
in her curvy pages.

372
00:46:15,658 --> 00:46:20,033
Her chest there was staring
like two dark eyes.

373
00:46:42,908 --> 00:46:44,742
What is it?

374
00:46:45,825 --> 00:46:47,450
Are you crying?

375
00:46:50,658 --> 00:46:52,658
What's wrong?

376
00:46:52,742 --> 00:46:54,242
What is it?

377
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,033
Is it me?

378
00:47:14,783 --> 00:47:18,617
Do not be sad. Not because of me.

379
00:47:23,908 --> 00:47:25,408
Lie still.

380
00:47:41,117 --> 00:47:42,700
Stop!

381
00:47:54,492 --> 00:47:56,867
The cold lights of Paris don't clothe you.

382
00:47:59,033 --> 00:48:04,825
To get to know you,
I take you where the palms grow.

383
00:48:12,117 --> 00:48:15,283
See yourself. You fade away here.
You need light.

384
00:48:15,408 --> 00:48:18,533
- I'm not leaving alone.
- You're not going to be alone.

385
00:48:20,158 --> 00:48:23,908
You're a model. You are seductive.
Someone will take care of you.

386
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:29,118
You have to take away.

387
00:48:29,129 --> 00:48:31,835
I can't do explain it,
but that's how it is.

388
00:48:33,033 --> 00:48:34,783
When are you coming?

389
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:40,075
You love me and chase me away.

390
00:48:44,575 --> 00:48:46,158
You need me.

391
00:48:59,908 --> 00:49:01,908
Stop! It is enough!

392
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:04,200
I don't want to be angry.

393
00:49:04,283 --> 00:49:06,992
We had a good time together.

394
00:49:19,825 --> 00:49:24,075
You will need them.
Honey, you gotta go now. Come here.

395
00:50:12,117 --> 00:50:15,283
- Why are you sending me home?
- I did not know it!

396
00:50:16,992 --> 00:50:20,783
This is your fault!
That is not his decision.

397
00:50:25,908 --> 00:50:29,450
- He's coming back to me.
- He loves me!

398
00:50:30,867 --> 00:50:33,992
He needs me. I do whatever he wants.

399
00:50:34,075 --> 00:50:37,617
- And? It's not love.
- What do you know about that?

400
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,533
I know how to love men.
One cannot learn to love.

401
00:50:41,658 --> 00:50:45,533
Don't you understand? You know nothing.

402
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:19,533
Take a seat.

403
00:51:33,575 --> 00:51:36,283
He likes, when we do this.

404
00:51:38,617 --> 00:51:40,283
Head to foot.

405
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:43,992
Can you do that?

406
00:52:44,242 --> 00:52:45,908
See.

407
00:52:59,658 --> 00:53:01,450
That's your darling.

408
00:53:12,242 --> 00:53:14,617
It just needs your fingers.

409
00:54:19,117 --> 00:54:20,825
Pierre...

410
00:54:21,783 --> 00:54:24,533
Do you remember when you told me...

411
00:54:26,825 --> 00:54:29,658
...that with you my future was assured.

412
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:33,617
In the grave...

413
00:54:36,492 --> 00:54:38,783
...will you write to me.

414
00:54:40,658 --> 00:54:43,575
To prove that we still have
something together.

415
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:48,158
Pierre, I love you so much.

416
00:54:58,617 --> 00:55:00,450
I read your book.

417
00:55:03,908 --> 00:55:05,617
And?

418
00:55:08,575 --> 00:55:10,950
The scandal is going to make you rich.

419
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:15,117
An excellent story. It seems true.

420
00:55:17,825 --> 00:55:20,783
However, I think
your cuckoo is missing something.

421
00:55:21,617 --> 00:55:23,408
Nobility, possibly.

422
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:26,867
A stronger expression.

423
00:55:30,367 --> 00:55:32,033
Do you think so?

424
00:55:35,617 --> 00:55:37,908
Are you feeling well?

425
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:40,242
Yes.

426
00:55:40,325 --> 00:55:42,325
- Are you in love?
- No.

427
00:55:43,783 --> 00:55:45,908
I'm concerned.

428
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:49,117
- Are you kidding me?
- No I mean it.

429
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,158
I threw Zohra out.

430
00:55:54,242 --> 00:55:57,283
She was a burden, but now I miss her.

431
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:05,617
You don't believe in love
but exhibit all symptoms.

432
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,450
It's not love. It's passion.

433
00:56:08,533 --> 00:56:11,658
It destroys one, but you can't help it.

434
00:56:16,575 --> 00:56:19,283
You have to get asked his passions.

435
00:56:21,075 --> 00:56:23,617
Why not go to Algeria?

436
00:57:08,908 --> 00:57:12,908
- Stop. I will not.
- Come on, just this one time.

437
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:15,783
Stop, I said! It's not a breeze!

438
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:52,325
I want to be in Algeria,
when you receive this.

439
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:56,242
Do you behave properly until
I'm coming home? Will you write?

440
00:57:56,325 --> 00:57:57,325
Think of me.

441
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:12,283
You can talk to me.

442
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:18,075
I can not.

443
00:59:20,908 --> 00:59:23,283
I love only one person worldwide.

444
00:59:23,408 --> 00:59:25,200
Forget him.

445
00:59:26,283 --> 00:59:28,033
Come and see.

446
00:59:32,158 --> 00:59:34,408
Wait, come on...

447
00:59:34,492 --> 00:59:36,658
Come see the ring.

448
00:59:36,742 --> 00:59:38,742
Can you see it?

449
00:59:40,742 --> 00:59:43,033
Forget him. He makes you unhappy.

450
00:59:44,367 --> 00:59:46,033
I can not.

451
00:59:52,992 --> 00:59:54,450
There.

452
00:59:54,533 --> 00:59:55,950
Perfect.

453
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:58,408
You are so Beautiful! Stand still.

454
01:00:00,908 --> 01:00:02,617
You are beautiful.

455
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,908
So beautiful. You make me tough.

456
01:00:06,492 --> 01:00:08,908
Men Pierre...

457
01:00:11,075 --> 01:00:13,075
I made you smile.

458
01:00:15,492 --> 01:00:17,117
I got a smile.

459
01:00:18,908 --> 01:00:21,242
Good appetite, my own.

460
01:00:21,283 --> 01:00:24,992
The soup is as good as ever.

461
01:00:25,075 --> 01:00:27,325
Henri, you are perfect.

462
01:00:34,033 --> 01:00:35,200
Reach?

463
01:00:40,325 --> 01:00:42,200
Thank you, Hélène.

464
01:00:43,242 --> 01:00:46,158
Marie is the most artistic
of my daughters.

465
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:50,825
The most sensitive and fragile.
Cheer her up. Entertain her.

466
01:00:50,908 --> 01:00:54,158
Take her for horse racing.
She loves horses.

467
01:00:54,242 --> 01:00:55,908
Take in the opera.

468
01:00:56,658 --> 01:00:59,533
- What do I know...
- She refuses to go out.

469
01:00:59,617 --> 01:01:02,867
I am afraid to leave her alone.

470
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:05,158
She is considering divorce.

471
01:01:05,242 --> 01:01:08,325
- She is capable of everything.
- No...

472
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:13,200
We must put an end to her melancholy.
Protect her from herself.

473
01:01:13,283 --> 01:01:17,450
Entertain her.
Get her out of the room, damn it.

474
01:01:17,533 --> 01:01:20,658
Don't let her act like a little girl.

475
01:01:20,742 --> 01:01:25,200
- Act like her husband.
- Yes, like her husband...

476
01:01:56,783 --> 01:01:58,617
You are.

477
01:01:58,742 --> 01:02:00,117
Jean!

478
01:02:01,408 --> 01:02:03,700
So you weren't a ghost?

479
01:02:03,783 --> 01:02:06,075
Otherwise, it would not
be totally impossible here.

480
01:02:10,783 --> 01:02:14,033
I like it there terrible insect.
What about you?

481
01:02:14,117 --> 01:02:17,325
I admire it,
as someone admires the horror.

482
01:02:17,492 --> 01:02:19,658
It's scary up close.

483
01:02:19,742 --> 01:02:23,033
You're a slut.
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

484
01:02:29,575 --> 01:02:31,867
Couple arru sada.

485
01:02:31,908 --> 01:02:33,908
Exactly. Arru sada.

486
01:02:33,992 --> 01:02:37,075
- Netsuke.
- Yes... Fly.

487
01:02:38,908 --> 01:02:40,158
Fun.

488
01:02:41,283 --> 01:02:43,158
- What?
- So many flies.

489
01:02:43,242 --> 01:02:45,867
One more. Sponge and fly.

490
01:02:48,908 --> 01:02:52,200
- "Fly and lotus leaf."
- "Volubilis and fly."

491
01:03:02,783 --> 01:03:05,867
To overcome your fears.

492
01:03:08,992 --> 01:03:10,783
Do you like it?

493
01:03:13,908 --> 01:03:15,908
My happiness amulet.

494
01:03:16,825 --> 01:03:18,450
Are you currently working?

495
01:03:18,533 --> 01:03:21,492
I write. Willy is the sender.

496
01:03:21,533 --> 01:03:23,533
You should write yourself.

497
01:03:23,575 --> 01:03:25,450
I love what you're doing.

498
01:03:27,575 --> 01:03:30,908
- Have you read what I've written?
- Of course.

499
01:03:32,617 --> 01:03:35,033
I'm proud, that you like my work.

500
01:03:35,075 --> 01:03:37,033
I am happy to see you.

501
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:40,825
I'm so bored.

502
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,158
Without me?

503
01:03:44,242 --> 01:03:46,867
I didn't say that. I said I'm bored.

504
01:03:46,908 --> 01:03:48,617
Along with another.

505
01:03:50,658 --> 01:03:52,742
You make me laugh.

506
01:03:52,825 --> 01:03:55,492
A good start.
You looked a little courageous.

507
01:03:55,575 --> 01:03:57,825
I didn't dare say anything.

508
01:04:00,992 --> 01:04:02,450
Are you feeling better now?

509
01:04:18,075 --> 01:04:21,242
It's bitter. I like it.

510
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:23,492
Taste.

511
01:04:27,117 --> 01:04:30,033
You have no idea how bad I am.

512
01:04:35,908 --> 01:04:37,908
You think I'm silly.

513
01:04:39,117 --> 01:04:40,867
Foolish? No.

514
01:04:42,783 --> 01:04:44,950
Surprising.

515
01:04:45,033 --> 01:04:46,533
Shy.

516
01:04:50,992 --> 01:04:52,533
Exciting.

517
01:04:53,908 --> 01:04:57,575
I sense you're coming to make me suffer.

518
01:05:01,533 --> 01:05:04,825
- So you come?
- Yes, I'm coming.

519
01:05:04,908 --> 01:05:08,033
- And want to be my mistress?
- It does not matter.

520
01:05:08,117 --> 01:05:11,575
Yes, for anyone.
Maybe not for you, but...

521
01:05:16,158 --> 01:05:18,158
When?

522
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,242
Cursed travel craving!

523
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:23,075
Uh, I spit in my hand.

524
01:05:23,158 --> 01:05:25,367
Why did he do that?

525
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:29,658
Since then, my beauty is meaningless.
In vain my body smells...

526
01:05:29,742 --> 01:05:32,533
and my seductive, strident bosom.

527
01:05:32,617 --> 01:05:35,033
Being unfaithful to him with a dwarf.

528
01:05:35,117 --> 01:05:38,033
But nothing can surpass my beloved.

529
01:05:38,117 --> 01:05:40,450
How unstable this young man is.

530
01:05:40,575 --> 01:05:43,075
With the little Zohra he will lie down.

531
01:05:43,158 --> 01:05:47,242
A delight while I am merely an atom.

532
01:05:47,325 --> 01:05:51,658
Being unfaithful to him with a dwarf,
but nothing can surpass my beloved.

533
01:05:56,325 --> 01:06:00,658
In the shade under this date palm
a slave undresses you.

534
01:06:00,742 --> 01:06:02,949
Here, completely naked

535
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:05,408
your young girl's body...

536
01:06:08,242 --> 01:06:10,950
Massive shade and strong sun.

537
01:06:10,992 --> 01:06:13,367
Part out your brown skin.

538
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:15,533
The day goes softly,

539
01:06:15,617 --> 01:06:18,242
and leaves you bluish in the moonlight.

540
01:06:19,783 --> 01:06:22,700
But nothing can surpass my beloved.

541
01:06:24,533 --> 01:06:27,700
I'll return, so don't scold me.

542
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:29,950
I know now that I love you.

543
01:06:29,992 --> 01:06:34,075
Don't say you don't believe me.
You are not like other women.

544
01:06:34,158 --> 01:06:40,450
You don't know about their jealousy.
You say you're an old man.

545
01:06:40,492 --> 01:06:42,117
Do you remember that?

546
01:06:52,783 --> 01:06:55,967
Jean, don't come to the apartment
on Tuesday.

547
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:57,085
It is over.

548
01:06:57,117 --> 01:07:01,658
I said it couldn't last by.
Sorry if I hurt you.

549
01:07:03,283 --> 01:07:06,200
Don't cry over me. I am not worth it.

550
01:07:06,283 --> 01:07:08,200
Marie.

551
01:08:14,075 --> 01:08:17,450
- Sit still.
- It is not easy.

552
01:08:17,533 --> 01:08:20,117
Be like an apple. Are they moving?

553
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,658
- An Apple. I'm an apple.
- Smile.

554
01:08:22,742 --> 01:08:25,658
- What are you doing?
- Concentrate.

555
01:08:25,742 --> 01:08:29,367
It is impossible! It's torture, Marie!

556
01:08:29,492 --> 01:08:31,200
I know.

557
01:08:31,283 --> 01:08:33,783
- It's new to me.
- For me too.

558
01:08:33,867 --> 01:08:35,742
You can't see that. Quiet now.

559
01:08:35,825 --> 01:08:37,492
- One more?
- No no.

560
01:08:37,575 --> 01:08:39,117
- Is last.
- With you?

561
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,075
Bad boy!

562
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:42,700
- Do you agree?
- Yes.

563
01:09:06,992 --> 01:09:08,492
Are you here?

564
01:09:21,033 --> 01:09:24,450
What strikes me, is the doubt of the past.

565
01:09:26,283 --> 01:09:28,575
I think she loved me.

566
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:32,783
She stole my thoughts.

567
01:09:32,908 --> 01:09:35,742
She takes the best from me.

568
01:09:35,825 --> 01:09:37,908
I have anxiety.

569
01:09:44,742 --> 01:09:48,700
You must understand me, Pierre.
I can't live anymore.

570
01:10:58,283 --> 01:10:59,700
Listen to me!

571
01:10:59,783 --> 01:11:01,908
I've never loved him!

572
01:11:03,617 --> 01:11:06,450
Listen! Pierre, listen to me!

573
01:11:07,783 --> 01:11:09,158
Listen to me.

574
01:11:10,617 --> 01:11:12,325
You left me here.

575
01:11:14,033 --> 01:11:16,492
I never stopped being yours.

576
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:20,783
With loving you.

577
01:11:20,867 --> 01:11:23,742
To whisper your name.

578
01:11:23,783 --> 01:11:26,450
To yearn for your mouth.

579
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:27,908
I love you.

580
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,950
I love you. Do you hear me?

581
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:33,117
You have to believe me.

582
01:11:33,158 --> 01:11:35,242
You have to to believe me, Pierre.

583
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,492
A release?

584
01:11:50,575 --> 01:11:53,158
No, something more personal.

585
01:11:54,117 --> 01:11:57,200
You must be appointed Library Director?

586
01:11:57,283 --> 01:12:00,117
Soon, but that's not it.

587
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:03,033
- Is it about your wife?
- No, about Marie.

588
01:12:03,992 --> 01:12:06,908
Okay, Marie...

589
01:12:07,575 --> 01:12:09,492
She's expecting children.

590
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,950
He is affected,
as he was part of the family.

591
01:12:12,992 --> 01:12:15,283
My grandchild. Can you imagine?

592
01:12:16,325 --> 01:12:18,533
A grandson, a grandson...

593
01:12:18,617 --> 01:12:22,700
I hope it becomes a boy.
Girls are only in trouble.

594
01:12:23,867 --> 01:12:29,742
Do you want to be the child's godfather?
It would mean a lot to me.

595
01:12:29,825 --> 01:12:32,450
We will call him Pierre.

596
01:12:32,533 --> 01:12:34,242
If it's a boy.

597
01:12:39,117 --> 01:12:41,283
My child, forget Pierre.

598
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:44,033
You can't refuse your husband an heir.

599
01:12:44,117 --> 01:12:48,783
He has been patient with you.
It will make you both happy.

600
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:52,033
Happy?

601
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:54,033
That's how you feel right now.

602
01:12:55,283 --> 01:12:58,908
But soon you will begin to live again.
Love again.

603
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:03,158
Soon life will be beautiful again.

604
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:11,075
Forain wants you to smile.

605
01:13:13,283 --> 01:13:15,242
On your portrait.

606
01:13:17,283 --> 01:13:21,325
Pierre, your silence hurts me like that.

607
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:24,617
I'm sure, that the little tiger inside me,

608
01:13:24,658 --> 01:13:28,950
is the fruit of our carelessness,
before leaving.

609
01:13:29,825 --> 01:13:33,783
Even after.
The baby should be born in September.

610
01:13:34,867 --> 01:13:37,117
Answer me. I beg you.

611
01:13:38,492 --> 01:13:41,408
Without you, life is worth nothing.

612
01:13:41,492 --> 01:13:43,117
The fly.

613
01:13:46,492 --> 01:13:48,492
My tiger.

614
01:13:49,908 --> 01:13:51,533
Little Pierre.

615
01:15:57,908 --> 01:16:00,200
I buy some lemonade.

616
01:16:00,283 --> 01:16:02,658
There is a kiosk nearby.

617
01:16:27,325 --> 01:16:29,533
My little Pierre...

618
01:16:37,242 --> 01:16:40,700
- He's scared of me.
- He needs to get to know you.

619
01:16:46,908 --> 01:16:48,783
Did you see how he looks like you?

620
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,867
He's prettier.

621
01:16:56,158 --> 01:16:58,617
Now something connects us forever.

622
01:17:05,992 --> 01:17:07,908
I love you.

623
01:17:10,575 --> 01:17:12,158
Do you mean it?

624
01:17:13,158 --> 01:17:15,908
How long? A quarter?

625
01:17:19,075 --> 01:17:21,742
What's so much fun?

626
01:17:21,825 --> 01:17:25,283
He asked about Tiger,
is going to look like his father.

627
01:17:27,492 --> 01:17:30,825
I hope he looks like his mother.
Not true, old friend?

628
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,658
See!

629
01:17:42,242 --> 01:17:44,950
Take one of these home from Africa.

630
01:17:47,325 --> 01:17:50,075
A photograph of Tiger and his cousins.

631
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:52,533
Look, little Pierre. Tigers!

632
01:17:54,033 --> 01:17:55,575
Stand here.

633
01:17:56,867 --> 01:17:58,200
Perfect.

634
01:18:00,783 --> 01:18:02,700
A smile, little Pierre.

635
01:18:04,325 --> 01:18:05,867
A smile.

636
01:18:05,908 --> 01:18:07,283
Stand still.

637
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,408
Henri, move.

638
01:18:13,492 --> 01:18:15,450
Of course. Sorry.

639
01:18:15,533 --> 01:18:17,575
First mother and child.

640
01:18:19,033 --> 01:18:21,158
Henri, you are so clumsy!

641
01:18:22,283 --> 01:18:25,450
- Are you going home?
- Sorry, that was a stupid idea.

642
01:18:25,533 --> 01:18:27,033
He is hungry.

643
01:18:46,575 --> 01:18:49,325
- Are you hurt?
- It is okay.

644
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:51,200
It's barely noticeable.

645
01:19:12,992 --> 01:19:15,867
- Pierre...
- Yes?

646
01:19:15,908 --> 01:19:18,992
Do you think I'm a pitiful cuckold?

647
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:28,283
I think our friendship and yours
Decency does not give you any choice.

648
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,367
I see compassion in your gaze.

649
01:19:33,450 --> 01:19:35,492
No not at all.

650
01:19:42,992 --> 01:19:45,825
Rather it is you than someone else.

651
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:52,117
Without you, I would have given up.

652
01:19:54,825 --> 01:19:57,325
It's a debt I can never pay off.

653
01:19:57,450 --> 01:19:58,617
The...

654
01:20:01,908 --> 01:20:03,992
Yes, Pierre.

655
01:20:04,117 --> 01:20:05,658
You can.

656
01:24:04,158 --> 01:24:06,200
Madame de Heredia.

657
01:24:13,867 --> 01:24:18,033
- Sorry for bothering me so late.
- Has something happened?

658
01:24:19,033 --> 01:24:21,200
I leave you alone.

659
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:31,810
I am grateful for,
that Henri appointed your father

660
01:24:31,821 --> 01:24:33,085
and has housed us.

661
01:24:33,158 --> 01:24:36,242
Otherwise, we would have been homeless.

662
01:24:36,325 --> 01:24:39,367
But we still have Louise. You know her.

663
01:24:39,492 --> 01:24:41,700
She gets her ideas.

664
01:24:41,783 --> 01:24:43,075
She wants to get married.

665
01:24:44,533 --> 01:24:45,950
Then married her away.

666
01:24:46,908 --> 01:24:51,158
It is not easy without dowry.
She only talks about Pierre Louÿs.

667
01:24:53,742 --> 01:24:55,242
Loulouse?

668
01:24:56,325 --> 01:24:59,658
She would be called Louise Louÿs.
Ridiculous!

669
01:25:04,575 --> 01:25:06,617
What's wrong with you?

670
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:08,617
Are you excited?

671
01:25:09,658 --> 01:25:11,075
Not at all.

672
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:18,158
You know, that he is not that type.

673
01:25:18,242 --> 01:25:20,950
He travels all the time.

674
01:25:20,992 --> 01:25:23,908
He goes out with his mistresses.

675
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:26,075
Louise would be unhappy.

676
01:25:27,325 --> 01:25:30,908
Why shouldn't she be happy? You are.

677
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:33,617
MLH, as before.

678
01:26:33,742 --> 01:26:35,617
Tomorrow at four o'clock.

679
01:26:55,825 --> 01:27:00,783
- Loulouse? What brings you here?
- The friendship between our families.

680
01:27:02,492 --> 01:27:05,617
Listen up. Dad has no money.

681
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:10,158
No dowry, no man,
so I have to take care of myself.

682
01:27:10,242 --> 01:27:12,533
May I become your secretary?

683
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:47,033
Did you send Louise over to me?

684
01:27:50,033 --> 01:27:52,200
You could have resisted.

685
01:27:54,783 --> 01:27:57,117
You can't take decisions on my behalf.

686
01:27:59,950 --> 01:28:02,158
It was you who made the decision.

687
01:28:03,283 --> 01:28:07,242
When you gave in,
you obliged you to marry her.

688
01:28:12,575 --> 01:28:15,658
Your marriage will be like mine
and Henri's.

689
01:28:15,783 --> 01:28:17,992
I don't want to get married!

690
01:28:24,492 --> 01:28:26,908
It gets so much easier.

691
01:28:29,575 --> 01:28:32,950
I can visit you.

692
01:28:33,033 --> 01:28:35,742
Take care of you and be close to you.

693
01:28:37,492 --> 01:28:40,533
That way, I never lose you.

694
01:28:48,783 --> 01:28:51,533
Don't you need more women then?

695
01:28:53,450 --> 01:28:56,283
I love you enough to share you.

696
01:28:56,450 --> 01:28:58,492
Do you hear what I'm saying?

697
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:03,950
Who would you love deepest?

698
01:29:03,992 --> 01:29:05,283
Marie?

699
01:29:05,408 --> 01:29:06,908
Louise?

700
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:10,033
Or the woman of your dreams,
that we two have created?

701
01:29:16,492 --> 01:29:18,117
Imagine...

702
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:21,950
Imagine her damp hair.

703
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:25,992
Her shoulders looking forward.

704
01:29:28,575 --> 01:29:31,492
You spread her lure

705
01:29:31,575 --> 01:29:36,033
and seek her mouth,
as I hear moaning without me seeing it.

706
01:29:36,117 --> 01:29:39,617
It gets stuck in me.

707
01:29:43,742 --> 01:29:45,658
You compare our breasts.

708
01:29:45,742 --> 01:29:48,117
Our genitals.

709
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,950
Our moans and our cries.

710
01:29:51,950 --> 01:29:54,992
You spend the afternoons with me.

711
01:29:55,075 --> 01:29:57,200
And the nights with Louise.

712
01:29:59,367 --> 01:30:02,283
You will remember our first time.

713
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:08,783
The same brown lures. The same mouth.

714
01:30:15,492 --> 01:30:19,575
You want to make Louise happy,
but also me.

715
01:30:54,283 --> 01:30:56,700
You sneak like a cat.

716
01:30:57,533 --> 01:31:00,575
Excuse my appearance. Had I known...

717
01:31:03,033 --> 01:31:05,158
Your miniature monocle...

718
01:31:13,075 --> 01:31:16,742
- There's something I have to tell you.
- Say nothing. Never.

719
01:31:21,283 --> 01:31:23,283
I have started writing.

720
01:31:27,783 --> 01:31:29,950
Want to read what I've written?

721
01:31:30,825 --> 01:31:33,575
- Your opinion is invaluable.
- Of course.

722
01:31:36,283 --> 01:31:38,033
A love story?

723
01:31:40,033 --> 01:31:41,867
Does it end happily?

724
01:31:43,825 --> 01:31:47,283
All love is finally extinguished.
Did not you know that?

725
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:59,492
Do you go without saying anything?

726
01:32:59,575 --> 01:33:03,575
- Come on.
- Marie, the photographer is waiting.

727
01:33:03,658 --> 01:33:05,200
You are late.

728
01:33:05,283 --> 01:33:07,658
- A kiss.
- You are beautiful.

729
01:33:09,158 --> 01:33:12,783
You tried your wedding dress.
Seeing it ahead of time brings bad luck.

730
01:33:12,867 --> 01:33:15,908
- Is it true?
- Loulouse, come on.

731
01:33:15,950 --> 01:33:18,658
Why didn't you say that?

732
01:35:33,450 --> 01:35:35,033
Open your eyes.

733
01:35:59,742 --> 01:36:04,658
Mothers should not give their
daughters' books which read:

734
01:36:04,742 --> 01:36:09,492
"Don't lie to your sister's lover.
It's incest."

735
01:36:09,575 --> 01:36:12,033
Girls always find an excuse.

736
01:36:27,283 --> 01:36:29,950
Landouzy was over yesterday at five.

737
01:36:30,033 --> 01:36:35,158
He prescribed hydrotherapy.
Everything I see dazzles me.

738
01:36:39,950 --> 01:36:44,992
Never have I practiced so much.
Never have I gone to bed so early.

739
01:36:45,075 --> 01:36:47,367
Can you imagine that? Me?

740
01:36:47,492 --> 01:36:51,242
I, who loved cigarettes,
dark-haired women and glossy sides

741
01:36:51,325 --> 01:36:53,533
is now forced into abstinence.

742
01:36:54,575 --> 01:36:56,200
It's a relief.

743
01:36:56,283 --> 01:36:58,700
Gérard d'Houville L'INCONSTANTE

744
01:36:59,658 --> 01:37:01,325
If I get better,

745
01:37:01,450 --> 01:37:04,658
I'm glad to have seen all in a new way.

746
01:37:05,658 --> 01:37:07,825
The slightly dazzling...

747
01:37:08,825 --> 01:37:12,867
...amplifies the reflections
and light up the shadows...

748
01:37:14,075 --> 01:37:18,492
...and show me a new nature.
A much more beautiful one.

749
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:25,992
And don't get better,
exist all the pictures I took...

750
01:37:26,075 --> 01:37:30,533
- No one can take them from you.
- No.

751
01:37:31,658 --> 01:37:33,617
They exist within me.

752
01:37:35,075 --> 01:37:40,283
To relive them, I close eyes
and see them for me.

753
01:37:47,408 --> 01:37:51,992
Thanks to you, the shelves are empty.
The Revue de Paris goes like hot bread.

754
01:37:52,075 --> 01:37:55,783
Is it true? Empty?
So Gérard d'Houville is a success?

755
01:37:55,867 --> 01:37:58,992
They probably think that Gérard d'Houville

756
01:37:59,117 --> 01:38:03,658
is an old bearded and dull man
and not a beautiful young woman.

757
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:07,825
It might increase sales.

758
01:38:08,825 --> 01:38:11,533
Everyone loves love stories.

759
01:38:11,658 --> 01:38:14,908
Especially when they are shocking.

760
01:38:14,950 --> 01:38:16,950
Did I shock you?

761
01:38:18,033 --> 01:38:20,033
No, you have charmed me.

762
01:38:21,033 --> 01:38:24,950
No need to be exotic
like Louÿs to describe a topic.

763
01:38:25,033 --> 01:38:29,117
You feel you are talking about
them even without wrapping.

764
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:32,658
It is almost manly.

765
01:38:32,742 --> 01:38:34,200
It is modern.

766
01:38:35,325 --> 01:38:37,200
Don't talk badly about my friend.

767
01:38:37,283 --> 01:38:39,908
He is an artist. A great poet.

768
01:38:40,950 --> 01:38:43,158
As long as he doesn't forget.

769
01:38:44,617 --> 01:38:47,242
Do you have time to have dinner
with me tonight?

770
01:38:47,325 --> 01:38:49,117
Not tonight.

771
01:38:51,075 --> 01:38:52,992
See you later.

772
01:39:01,033 --> 01:39:04,742
Don't forget that one night
we experienced the only hour

773
01:39:05,158 --> 01:39:08,117
where the gods gave us for a moment.

774
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:11,783
An oblique head. A shuddering shoulder.

775
01:39:11,867 --> 01:39:15,033
The pure joy of life, as fleeting as time.

776
01:39:16,117 --> 01:39:18,617
Remember that night

777
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:20,325
where we lay in our bed

778
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:24,450
and touched each other's fingers,
who trembled met.

779
01:39:24,575 --> 01:39:27,450
We shared, word of mouth...

780
01:39:28,617 --> 01:39:32,200
...the unforgettable gem,
where the memory slumber.
